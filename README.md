**<h1>MACHINE LEARNING DOCKERFILE :whale:</h1>**
**<h2>A Docker file for Creating a Machine Learning (ML) Docker Image</h2>**
Creating the perfect environment for machine learning can be a very big struggle, with so many winding roads. Getting an ML container that actually works is quite scarce and can be a big deal.

This dockerfile was designed to create an ML docker image, and by extension, containter that actually works :sunglasses:
