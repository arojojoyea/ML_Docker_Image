**<h1>MACHINE LEARNING DOCKER FILE</h1>**
**<h2>A Docker file for Creating a Machine Learning (ML) Docker Image</h2>**
Creating the perfect environment for machine learning can be a very big struggle, with so many winding roads. Getting a ML container that actually works is quite scarce and can be a big deal.
This docker file was designed to create a machine learning docker image, and by extension, a containter that actually works :sunglasses:

**<h2>The Constituents</h2>**
The docker image contains the following installations:

- [x] Prefect
- [x] Jupyter
- [x] Pandas
- [x] Tensorflow
- [x] Pytorch
- [x] Plotly
- [x] Boto3
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Scipy
- [x] Opencv
